# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The development of the game entails creating variables in a list of fruits with basic Python commands. The game is programmed to generate random selection from the list using Python random() built-in functions. Users are then prompted to select a certain letter which is validated with Python len(0) and isalpha() functions.

All modifications are staged, committed  and pushed to GitHub.
